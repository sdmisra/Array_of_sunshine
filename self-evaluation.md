## Arrays Evaluation

- How confident do you feel with arrays so far?
I feel fairly confident with the basics, but I did have some trouble when trying to use negative numbers to reference the indicies in my arrays. I would get "undefined" as the value with the type of returning as "undefined" as well, and I wasn't sure why! I settled on showing my understanding with positive numbers, but it is a thread I will keep pulling on until I understand how to use negative numbers to begin counting from the end of an array.

- Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before the next lesson?

See above - I want to understand what is happening when I count backwards from the end and get lost in undefinied space, by using negative numbers to reference the index position of values.

- What questions do you have about Arrays?

I would love to learn if there are any practical uses for arrays with mixed data types within them. It seems like an incredibly niche / edge case scenario that one would want booleans, numbers, and strings in the same variable, but it must have happened at some point, somewhere, right?

I also would like to get more practice with Arrays, in general. I am not very comfortable yet with imagining what I am building without using console.log to check it at each step.
